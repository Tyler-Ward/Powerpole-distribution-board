# DC Distribution board for Anderson power-pole connectors.

This project is a fused DC distribution board.
The design uses Anderson powerpoles and ATC/ATO fuses which are in common use in amateur radio.
Unlike other DIY solutions this uses the powerpole 45A PCB contacts rather than short stubs of solid wire crimped to the powerpoles.

## Required parts

* 1*PCB - Should be made on a 2oz copper board.
* 4*Acrylic layers - one of each layer 3 at 6mm thick and one at 3mm thick
* 6*Anderson power pole connector pairs with 45A PCB connectors.
* 6*ATO fuse holders
* 6*330ohm resistors
* 6*3mm LEDs - bidirectional LEDs allow for fuse failure indication for both source and sinks
* 6*0.1uF Bypass capacitors

## Production files and Assembly instructions

Production files for the PCB and acrylic can be found in the releases list on github.
